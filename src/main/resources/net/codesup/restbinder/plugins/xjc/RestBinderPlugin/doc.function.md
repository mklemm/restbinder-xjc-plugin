The RestBinderPlugin extends code generated by the JAXB XSD-to-Java compiler (XJC), such that
there will be new `get` accessor methods for each XLink-like reference element in all generated
classes.

The link element defintitions must be annotated with the `target` customization element in the following way:

Add this to the `schema` element of your XSD:
```
xmlns:rb="http://www.codesup.net/restbinder"
xmlns:jxb="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb"
jxb:version="1.0"
jxb:extension-element-prefixes="rb"
```


Then, at a reference element that implements XLink:
```
	<element name="my-ref" type="xlink:simple">
		<annotation>
			<appinfo>
				<rb:target ref="tns:other-element/>
			</appinfo>
		</annotation>
	</element>
```
